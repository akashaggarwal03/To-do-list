# To-do-list
A simple to do list to keep track of all the important work that a user might not want to forget about.
## My first Page
This is a complete front end simple web page which tells about the importance of a to do list and provide a button to create your own to do list .
This button will take you to a different page where you can add your work in your to do list.
Additional navigation buttons are added which are currently not working as they are totally part of back end work.
## My To Do List
This is just the form to add the works or jobs that the user want to get finished with at the end of the day. The date is not asked as the list is on a daily basis.But the time concept is being added.
## Pre-requisite
1. Any web browser

## Functions
It is a front end project so till now no commit is made to enable any button. On the initial page there is a button which points to a link taking you to different page where you can add your tasks to your list. The site works well to take your input.
1. All the elements are placed in a block level container.
2. My To Do List is placed in a inline level container inside the block level container.
3. A background image and a To Do List image is being added to make the site attractive.
## Languages Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
## Libraries Used
1.Bootstrap

#### Additional Information
This project currently lack the java script files and therefore no button is working and mainly the task in a to do list is not getting stored at any place.

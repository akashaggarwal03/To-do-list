## Functions
It is a front end project so till now no commit is made to enable any button. But the site works well to take your input.
1. All the elements are placed in a block level container.
2. My To Do List is placed in a inline level container inside the block level container.
3. A background image and a To Do List image is being added to make the site attractive.
4. A link is being added which will take you to a different tab with your list displayed but it still requires a commit to be made to get it working.
## Languages Used
1. HTML
